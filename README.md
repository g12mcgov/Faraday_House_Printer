3.	Now, download the script attached to this email called “<b>addPrinter</b>”.

4.	Once it’s download, double click it to run.

5.	You’ll probably get an error message saying something like “From an unidentiﬁed developer, blah blah blah…” Easy ﬁx.

6.	Go to <b>System Preferences > Security & Privacy > General</b>

7.	At the bottom it should say “addPrinter was blocked from opening.” Click “Open Anyway” to the right of it.

8.	Now, go back to where you downloaded the ﬁle, double click it again. Just hit “OK” if it says anything.

9.	The script needs your password. So type it in when it prompts you for it. NOTE: IT WILL NOT SHOW YOUR PASSWORD AS YOU’RE TYPING. This is totally normal!!
